This project is a tiny little compiler / preprocessor for the programming language used by mindustry's processor blocks (if you're here, you probably know what those are). I created this because I noticed a lack of "function-like" features in that language, making code duplication a big issue.

Usage :

`executable input_file`

from the command line. You can then pipe the output into a file if you want.
A rust toolchain is needed if you want to compile this project from scratch for yourself.

See the test.txt for the syntax (it's really not hard).

Enjoy, I guess ?

PS : keep in mind that this project was just a little tool I made for myself, so there's not much fancy stuff going on.
